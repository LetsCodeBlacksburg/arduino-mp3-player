# arduino-mp3-player

This class was written to take LCBB workshop participants through the steps of building their own Arduino controlled MP3 Player. The build doc for stepping through the workshop is here: 
https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/arduino-mp3-player/blob/master/LCBB_MP3-Player%2Btm1673-LED_Build-Doc.pdf

and the LCBB Arduino Cook Book with the requisite Arduino recipes is located here:

## Recommended Hardware
The hardware in this project is centered around the DFRobot "DFPlayer Mini MP3 Player" which can be found on Amazon for around $8-10(US) or direct from China for around $2-3.  We do recommend using arduinos with built in 3-pin SVG server/sensor headers such as the Funduino or sensor shield. Here's the complete parts list:
* 1 – Arduino board (w/SVG headers or sensor shield) - ex: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072P13CWC
* 1 – 9v Alkaline Battery w/clip & barrel connector - ex: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0764MDPK3
* 1 – DFPlayer mini, serial controllable MP3 player - ex: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077XS7XQK
* 1 – 1-4G µSD/TF card (w/mp3 sounds or music preloaded) - ex: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J090WZA
* 1 – Speaker (4-8ohm, 3W max) - ex: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078KXQG17
* 1 – TM1637 4 x 7-segment LED module (1-wire) - ex: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XRXQ5TQ
* 2 - 1kΩ resistors (for MP3 serial lines) - ex: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185FGTSS
* 1 – IR remote & sensor (not used yet) - ex: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DP1XVF
* 14 – Female/Female dupont connecting wires (assumes SVG connections) - ex: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073X7P6N2 
* (opt) - breadboard (if building other things like buttons, etc) - ex: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K47FYM2/
(all parts MUCH cheaper from AliExpress.com)
